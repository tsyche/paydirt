# Features

Current scope tracker. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for phasing and the full plan at `~/.windsurf/plans/choregalore-plan.md`.

## Implemented

- **Data model** — MVP collections ([docs/DATA_MODEL.md](./docs/DATA_MODEL.md)) as a verified PocketBase migration; TypeScript mirror in `packages/shared`.
- **Currency hooks** — verified against PocketBase 0.39.3: chore approval earns parentBucks, spend approval deducts, ledger maintains the cached balance, over-spending is blocked, re-approval is idempotent.
- **Notification hooks** — ntfy fires wired for chore assigned/completed/approved/rejected and spend submitted/resolved (HTTP send path not yet live-tested — needs a real ntfy topic).

## In Progress

- **App scaffolds** — Next.js (web) and Expo (mobile) not yet created.

## MVP Target

**Chores**
- Create/edit/delete chores (name, description, reward)
- One-off and recurring (daily, weekly, custom cadence)
- Assign to one or multiple children
- Status flow: assigned → completed (child) → approved/rejected (parent)
- Rejection notification with optional parent message
- Optional photo proof on completion

**Kid app**
- View assigned chores
- Mark complete (with optional photo)
- View parentBucks balance
- Submit spend request (parent notified immediately)
- Spend request history

**Parent app (web + Android)**
- Dashboard: pending approvals, chore status, balances
- Manage chores and assignments
- Approve/reject completions
- Approve/deny spend requests

**Currency**
- Configurable currency name and per-chore reward
- Earned on parent approval
- Spend flow: request → approve/deny → deduct

**Notifications (ntfy)**
- Child: chore assigned, spend approved/denied, chore rejected
- Parent: chore pending approval, spend request submitted
- Configurable topic per user
